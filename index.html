<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Presented by Team Anchovy, Fire Blanket is a nuclear power plant simulator... with a post-apocalyptic twist. Near the city of York, in the emerging shanty town of Town, the remnants of humanity fight for survival against a mutating horde of zombies, geese and the occasional St John's student. As the Power Plant operator, the responsibility falls to you to keep your people safe. Generate too much power and Town might explode, too little, and Town's defences may shut down...</p>
<p>With a wonderful storyline and built around Team Anchovy's SSS standard, Fire Blanket offers an immersive experience for Players and Developer's alike. Drawing on Industry Best Practise and conforming to exacting MVC standards, developers can rest assured that a handover from Anchovy will be a simple one. But don't take our word for it, download our code, explore our documentation, check out our <a href="dev-guide.html" target="_blank">Assessment 3 Developer's Guide</a> and come to your own conclusion.</p>

<h2>SSS Standard</h2>
<h3>Simple</h3>
<p>Simplicity is at the heart of everything that Team Anchoy does. We have gone to extremes to ensure that our classes are so self-contained you can remove them without affecting other parts of the program. This means that for Assessment 3, a team using Anchovy code will be able to treat most of the program as black box saving you time reading through code. Simply remove the UI, for example, and slot in a GUI as described in the <a href="dev-guide.html" target="_blank">Assessment 3 Developer's Guide</a> - how much easier could it be? </p>
<h3>Safe</h3>
<p>We appreciate that our claims about simplicity may seem exaggerated. They're not. To provide you with the reassurance that you need to trust our classes, and focus on that GUI development, we have conducted over 100 tests, so nothing unexpected happens. With an extensive Unit Test Suite, comprehensive dynamic testing and expansive acceptance testing, you can rest assured that you're in safe hands. How can this get any better? With full and transparent access to our test and fault logs so you can hold us accountable.</p>
<h3>Supported</h3>
<p>Just because you don’t have to interact with the rest of our code doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be able to. In order to ensure that any such interaction is as simple as possible, we have made a huge amount of supporting documentation available for your use. From our Requirement Specification to a complete JavaDocs explorer – everything we know about Fire Blanket is presented to you in a simple accessible way. Or, if you’re looking for something simpler, our Assessment 3 Developer’s guide provides concise step by step guidance on adding additional functionality. </p>

<h2>First Playthrough Guide</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the <a href="" target="_blank">game</a>.</li>
<li>Run <code>fireblanket.jar</code></li>
<li>Enter <code>new game &lt;your name goes in here&gt;</code></li>
<li>Type in <a href="user-man.html#game-commands" target="_blank">commands</a> to control the nuclear power plant.</li>
</ol>

<p>Produce sufficient electricity to sustain the infrastructure. Fail and you lose the game.
You also lose if you overheat the reactor, so be careful.</p>

<h2>Background story</h2>
<p>On the 8th April 2013, students at the University of York prepared to demonstrate their second year software projects. A challenging task, several teams had prepared video game simulations of nuclear power plants for their professor’s approval. Some projects were simple stand-alone affairs powered only by the department’s computers. Others utilised the internet to provide automatic updates. One such system would change the world forever. </p>

<p>Precisely one week from the initial deployment of the SEPR solutions, disaster shook the world. Propagating from one server to the next using obscure net technologies, an unidentified program began initiating the update protocols of the world’s major nuclear power plants. Inexplicably replacing SCADA systems with the student’s simulations, the world’s power plants began melting down in quick succession.
The ensuing blanket of fire engulfed the world, reducing civilisation to smouldering ash.
But the human race proved more resilient than could have been hoped, and pockets of life survived. One such region, spared of destruction by the recent decommission of its own power plant was none other than the city that spawned its downfall. York had survived, and with it, it’s university.
In the weeks that followed, urgent discussion took place across what was left of the city. Unified by an impromptu council of community leaders and prominent academics, the course was set for humanity’s fate. The survivors would require food, shelter, infrastructure and means of self-protection, and for this they would require electricity.</p>

<p>Enlisting the might of the nearby garrison of Northern Command, the council lead its citizens on a journey to re-commission its fatefully dormant nuclear facility. 
Months passed, and the decision to mobilise Northern Command proved to be a crucial one. The first signs of mutation arose in the form of rodents emerging from the irradiated ground. Whilst of little danger to humans, these rodents would herald the coming of a much greater threat to humanity.
With dwindling supplies, and rumours of larger mutating creatures converging towards the sounds of construction, the military remnants began a fevered fortification of the power plant. Enmeshed within electric fences and weapons systems, humanity’s final revival would likely be carried out against the shadow of constant siege. And to some, lingering memories of the destructive potential of nuclear power outweighed the protection that it afforded...</p>

<p>Six months have passed since the blanket of fire descended and the newly established outpost of Town has been born. The nuclear facility for which the town was created has been successfully commissioned by a team of surviving engineers lead by Professor Richard Paige, and in which you were involved. Following the untimely digestion of a senior operator by a stray mutated goose, you have been assigned a more prominent role in the functioning of the plant. Your presence in the control room has been requested by the Professor to explain your new responsibilities...</p>
